        <h4 className="list-label">Analytics Cookies (PostHog):</h4>
        <p className="paragraph">We use PostHog, a third-party analytics service, to collect information about how visitors use our website. This helps us understand user behavior, improve our website's performance, and tailor content to better meet the needs of our audience. PostHog sets the following cookies:</p>

            <dl className="list-description">This is a persistent cookie that uniquely identifies a user for analytical purposes. It allows PostHog to track user behavior across multiple sessions. This cookie expires in approximately one year. The data collected includes a unique user identifier (distinct_id) and session information ($sesid). While this cookie has a long duration, the session data it contains (e.g., timestamps) is updated on each new session, effectively making it function partly as a session cookie as well.</dl>

            <dl className="list-description">This persistent cookie also uniquely identifies users and stores additional information about their initial visit, such as the referring website (the site the user came from) and the specific page they landed on. This cookie also expires in approximately one year. The data collected includes a unique user identifier (distinct_id), session information ($sesid), and initial referrer and landing page URLs ($initial_person_info). This information may include query parameters in the URL that could potentially contain personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, location data, or other details provided in the URL.</dl>
